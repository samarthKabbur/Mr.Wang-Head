# Mr.Wang-Head
This code is meant to run an arduino in low power mode until it is activated by a timer, does some tasks, then falls asleep again. Unfortunately, the uno isn't the best for this (nano is) so my project didn't work out. Also the code was a bit buggy, unsupported libraries, arduino registeries wouldn't cooperate. With some edits, anyone can make this work for themselves. 
This is the code for the Automated Mr.Wang head we created.
Parts I used: 
Arduino UNO 
DS3231 RTC
2 wire speaker
dc motor
other electronic essentials (wires, resistors, etc). 
You can copy this, I guess.
